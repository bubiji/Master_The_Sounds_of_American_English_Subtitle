00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,400
In this American English pronunciation video,
在这段美式英语发音视频中，

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,580
we're going to learn how to make the R consonant sound.
我们将学习如何发出 R 辅音音。

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,060
This is truly one of the hardest sounds in American English.
这确实是美式英语中最难的音之一。

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,080
Before I go into how to make it,
在我讲解如何发这个音之前，

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,060
I want to talk about how not to make it.
我想先谈谈如何不发这个音。

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,720
In many languages, the R is made by bouncing the front part of the tongue against the roof of the mouth,
在许多语言中，R 是通过将舌头的前部弹到上颚来发出的，

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,060
rr, rr.
rr, rr。

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,580
In American English, this sound is the T or D between vowels,
在美式英语中，这个音是元音之间的 T 或 D，

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,960
but it's quite different from the American R.
但它与美式 R 相差甚远。

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,960
Rrr.
Rrr。

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,760
You can't hold out rr, rr,
你不能拖长 rr, rr，

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,520
but you should be able to hold out the American R.
但你应该能够拖长美式 R。

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,340
Rrr.
Rrr。

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,860
This consonant is voiced.
这个辅音是有声的。

15
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,320
There are two ways to make this sound.
有两种方法可以发出这个音。

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,240
In the first way,
第一种方法中，

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,400
the front part of the tongue pulls back and up,
舌头的前部向后并向上拉，

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,280
like this.
像这样。

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
It's fatter and thicker,
它变得更胖更厚，

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,000
and that's what we want here.
这就是我们想要的效果。

21
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:30,780
We're making the tongue fatter and thicker so it's not as long.
我们让舌头变得更胖更厚，这样它就不那么长了。

22
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:32,980
The back doesn't move.
后部不动。

23
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,360
This is happening with the front and middle of the tongue.
这是舌头的前部和中部在发生变化。

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,500
The middle part of the tongue lifts up towards the roof of the mouth.
舌头的中部抬起，靠近上颚。

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,340
You can touch the sides of the tongue to the sides of the roof of the mouth here,
你可以让舌头的两侧接触上颚的两侧，

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,620
or to the inside or bottom of the side teeth,
或者接触侧牙的内侧或底部，

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,060
here.
在这里。

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,820
The front part of the tongue is hanging in the middle of the mouth,
舌头的前部悬在口腔中间，

29
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:57,580
not touching anything.
不接触任何东西。

30
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,480
This sound is forward and focused because of the position of the lips.
由于嘴唇的位置，这个音是向前和集中的。

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,000
The corners come in,
嘴角收拢，

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,040
pushing the lips away from the face.
将嘴唇推离面部。

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,640
This lip position will be a little more relaxed when the R comes at the end of a syllable.
当 R 出现在音节末尾时，这种嘴唇位置会稍微放松一些。

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,460
With the other way,
另一种方法是，

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,500
to make an R, on the right.
在右边发 R。

36
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,000
The R can also be made by flipping the tongue tip up.
R 也可以通过将舌尖翻上来发出。

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
The lips flare the same way.
嘴唇以同样的方式张开。

38
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,520
Some native speakers make the R one way,
一些母语者用一种方法发 R，

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,100
and some the other.
而另一些用另一种方法。

40
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:39,380
Native speakers get the correct sound no matter the mouth position.
无论口腔位置如何，母语者都能发出正确的音。

41
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:46,940
But I've found that non-native speakers often drop the jaw too much in this second method,
但我发现，非母语者在使用第二种方法时，往往下巴掉得太多，

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,200
and it makes the sound hollow.
这使得声音空洞。

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,400
Rrr.
Rrr。

44
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,780
The jaw doesn't need to drop very much for this sound.
这个音不需要下巴掉得太多。

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,660
Rrr.
Rrr。

46
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:02,700
So keep this in mind as you work on one of these two methods.
所以在练习这两种方法之一时要记住这一点。

47
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,420
Here's the R sound on its own,
这是 R 音本身，

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,040
not part of a word.
不是单词的一部分。

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,280
You can see the lips flare.
你可以看到嘴唇张开。

50
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:15,640
Think of creating a little space between the inside of your lips and your teeth.
想象在嘴唇内侧和牙齿之间创造一点空间。

51
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:19,080
Notice how little jaw drop there is.
注意下巴掉得有多小。

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,540
We don't need to drop the jaw to pull the tongue back and up.
我们不需要下巴掉下来就能把舌头向后和向上拉。

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400

单词 rest。

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
When the R is at the beginning of a word,
当 R 在单词开头时，

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,740
we tend to make the lips a tight circle.
我们倾向于让嘴唇形成一个紧的圆圈。

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,020
Again, little jaw drop as the middle of the tongue lifts to the roof of the mouth.
同样，当舌头的中部抬到上颚时，下巴掉得很少。

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,800
The word proud.
单词 proud。

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,560
When R is in a beginning consonant cluster,
当 R 在开头的辅音群中时，

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,800
the lips may not be as tight as in a beginning R.
嘴唇可能不像开头 R 那样紧。

60
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,980
The word mother.
单词 mother。

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,120
At the end of a syllable,
在音节末尾，

62
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,460
the lip position for the R is definitely more relaxed than a beginning R,
R 的嘴唇位置肯定比开头 R 更放松，

63
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,500
but the lips still flare.
但嘴唇仍然张开。

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,220
Here,
在这里，

65
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,020
we compare the lip position of the beginning R in rest,
我们比较了单词 rest 中开头 R 的嘴唇位置，

66
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,620
above,
在上面，

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,900
to the ending R in mother, below.
和单词 mother 中结尾 R 的嘴唇位置，在下面。

68
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,100
The ending R lip position is much more relaxed.
结尾 R 的嘴唇位置要放松得多。

69
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:25,460
Thinking about the lip position will help you make a better R sound.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,220
As you work on this consonant,
在练习这个辅音时，

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,200
practice very slowly, thinking about all three things at once.
