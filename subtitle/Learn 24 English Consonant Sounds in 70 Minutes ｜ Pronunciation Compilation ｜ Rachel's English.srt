通过充分理解美式英语中的所有辅音音来提高你的英语口语清晰度。

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,960
Today is a compilation of every single consonant sound you need to know.
今天是你需要知道的每一个辅音音的汇编。

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,720
Some will be easy for you.
有些对你来说会很简单。

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,600
You have them in your own native language.
你在自己的母语中也有这些音。

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,720
Great! Just practice the words.
太好了！只需练习这些单词。

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,020
Others will be tricky, unfamiliar.
其他的会比较棘手，不太熟悉。

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,360
Use the photos to study the position and the up close slow motion shots.
使用照片来研究位置和特写慢动作镜头。

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,280
This will help make clear, for example, how much of the tongue tip needs to come through the teeth for the TH.
这将有助于清楚地了解，例如，TH音时舌尖需要伸出牙齿多少。

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,840
It's not much.
不需要太多。

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,620
Why not start with the TH?
为什么不从TH音开始呢？

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,760
Let's dive in.
让我们开始吧。

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,840
These sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.
这些音被配对在一起，因为它们使用相同的口腔位置。

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,140
Th is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through the mouth.
Th是无声的，意味着只有空气通过口腔。

14
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:54,280
And th is voiced, meaning you make a sound with the vocal cords.
而th是有声的，意味着你用声带发出声音。

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,380
The very tip of the tongue comes through the teeth.
舌尖的最前端伸出牙齿。

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,240
The air passes around the tongue.

00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,520
The tongue is relaxed.
舌头是放松的。

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,180
There shouldn't be any pressure in the mouth or a stop quality to this sound.
口腔中不应该有任何压力或停顿的感觉。

19
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,780
Just nice and easy.
只需轻松自然。

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:16,760
Th.
Th。

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,660
Th.
Th。

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,320
The tongue has to easily vibrate between the teeth.
舌头必须在牙齿之间轻松振动。

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,300
So keep the tongue soft and relaxed.
所以保持舌头柔软和放松。

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,720
Th.
Th。

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:37,020
The lips don't affect this sound, so they can be transitioning to the next sound.
嘴唇不影响这个音，所以它们可以过渡到下一个音。

26
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:45,320
For example, in the THR cluster, the lips will round a little bit for the R as you make the TH.
例如，在THR组合中，发TH音时嘴唇会稍微圆起来以发R音。

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
Three.
Three。

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,760
Three.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,360
Be careful with the tongue tip.
小心舌尖。

30
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,540
Make sure it doesn't come too far forward.
确保它不要伸得太远。

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,420
It's just the very tip that should come between the teeth.
只有舌尖的最前端应该在牙齿之间。

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,940
To make the unvoiced TH, the tongue tip absolutely has to come through the teeth.
要发无声的TH音，舌尖绝对必须伸出牙齿。

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,320
Th.
Th。

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,480
Th.
Th。

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,100
But the voiced TH can be different.
但有声的TH音可以不同。

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,520
When it's in an unstressed, quick word like these, or the.
当它在一个不重读的快速单词中时，比如these或the。

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,020
The tongue tip doesn't have to come through the teeth.
舌尖不必伸出牙齿。

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,720
It can press behind the teeth.
它可以压在牙齿后面。

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:39,320
Make sure the tongue isn't at the roof of the mouth, or pointing down, but pressing right in the middle, where the teeth come together.
确保舌头不是在口腔顶部，也不是向下，而是压在中间，牙齿合拢的地方。

40
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,420
If it's not in the right position, the sound will be wrong.
如果位置不对，发音就会错误。

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,040
Dd.
Dd。

42
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,220
Dd.
Dd。

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,440
These.
These。

44
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,780
Dd.
Dd。

45
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:55,720
This tongue shortcut works in these words because they're unstressed.
这个舌头捷径在这些单词中有效，因为它们是不重读的。

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,980
So when you don't bring your tongue tip through the teeth, it allows you to make these less important words quickly.
所以当你不把舌尖伸出牙齿时，它让你可以快速发出这些不太重要的单词。

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,600
These.
These。

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,220
Dd.
Dd。

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Let's look at these sounds up close and in slow motion.
让我们近距离慢动作看看这些音。

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,700
Notice how it's just the very tip that comes out of the teeth.
注意只有舌尖的最前端伸出牙齿。

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,380
The tongue is relaxed, the teeth surround it, but they're not clamping down on it.
舌头是放松的，牙齿围绕着它，但没有夹住它。

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,140
The lips and face are relaxed.
嘴唇和面部是放松的。

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,880
Throw.
Throw。

54
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:35,460
Notice how the lips are starting to flare for the R as the tongue comes through the teeth for the unvoiced TH.
注意当舌头伸出牙齿发无声的TH音时，嘴唇开始为R音张开。

55
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,880
Birthday.
Birthday。

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Keep in mind, when you only stick the very tip of your tongue out, the movement into other sounds isn't as hard as you might think.
记住，当你只伸出舌尖时，过渡到其他音的动作并不像你想象的那么难。

57
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:51,780
Watch the tongue tip come in and flip up for the D.
看舌尖进来并翻上去发D音。

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
To make it more natural.
让它更自然。

59
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,040

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,600
Tongue tip through the teeth for the voiced TH.
舌尖伸出牙齿发有声的TH音。

61
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,260
Lips and tongue are relaxed.
嘴唇和舌头是放松的。

62
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,160
Worth.
Worth。

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,040
Ending in the unvoiced TH.
以无声的TH音结尾。

64
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,460
Again, the lips and tongue look very relaxed.
再次，嘴唇和舌头看起来非常放松。

65
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:26,060
Remember to keep your tongue relaxed and soft when you practice this sound.
记住在练习这个音时保持舌头放松和柔软。

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,060
And unvoiced TH.
和无声的TH音。

67
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,140
Throw.

68
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,560

90
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,980
South.
South。

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,980
The R in American English is also such a tough sound for my students to get.
美式英语中的R音对我的学生来说也是一个很难掌握的音。

92
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,120
Here's the thing.
事情是这样的。

93
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,020
Most people need to simplify, do less with the tongue.
大多数人需要简化，减少舌头的动作。

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,400
Maybe round the lips a little bit more, but take out tension.
也许稍微多一点嘴唇的圆度，但要去掉紧张感。

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,680
Take a look.
看看吧。

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,480
This is truly one of the hardest sounds in American English.
这确实是美式英语中最难的音之一。

97
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,500
Before I go into how to make it, I want to talk about how not to make it.
在我讲如何发这个音之前，我想谈谈如何不发这个音。

98
00:05:57,184 --> 00:06:04,140
In many languages, the R is made by bouncing the front part of the tongue against the roof of the mouth.
在许多语言中，R音是通过舌头的前部在口腔顶部弹跳来发出的。

99
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,420
Ruh.
Ruh。

100
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,620
Ruh.
Ruh。

101
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:16,340
In American English, this sound is the T or D between vowels, but it's quite different from the American R.
在美式英语中，这个音是元音之间的T或D音，但它与美式R音有很大不同。

102
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,500
Rrrrr.
Rrrrr。

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,040
You can't hold out Ruh.
你不能长时间发Ruh。

104
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,140
Ruh.
Ruh。

105
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,940
But you should be able to hold out the American R.
但你应该能够长时间发美式R音。

106
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Rrrrr.
Rrrrr。

107
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,280
This consonant is voiced.
这个辅音是有声的。

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,740
There are two ways to make this sound.
有两种方法可以发这个音。

109
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,680
In the first way, the front part of the tongue pulls back and up, like this.
第一种方法是舌头的前部向后和向上拉，如此。

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,300
The back part of the tongue is made to hold itself, so it's fatter and thicker.
舌头的后部保持不动，使其更厚更胖。

111
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,420
And that's what we want here.
这就是我们想要的。

112
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:02,220
We're making the tongue fatter and thicker, so it's not as long.
我们让舌头更厚更胖，所以它不那么长。

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,380
The back doesn't move.
后部不动。

114
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,780
This is happening with the front and middle of the tongue.
这是舌头的前部和中部在动作。

115
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,900
The middle part of the tongue lifts up towards the roof of the mouth.
舌头的中部向口腔顶部抬起。

116
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:22,480
You can touch the sides of the tongue, to the sides of the roof of the mouth here, or to the inside or bottom of the side teeth, here.
你可以让舌头的两侧接触口腔顶部的两侧，或者接触侧牙的内侧或底部。

117
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,980
The front part of the tongue is hanging in the middle of the mouth, not touching anything.
舌头的前部悬在口腔中间，不接触任何东西。

118
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:34,840
This sound is forward and focused because of the position of the lips.
这个音是向前和集中的，因为嘴唇的位置。

119
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,400
The corners come in, pushing the lips away from the face.
嘴角收紧，把嘴唇推离面部。

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,020
This lip position will be a little more relaxed when the R comes at the end of a syllable.
当R音在音节末尾时，这个嘴唇位置会稍微放松一些。

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,900
We'll compare this way on the left with the other way, to make an R, on the right.
我们将左边的这种方法与右边的另一种发R音的方法进行比较。

122
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,360
The R can also be made by flipping the tongue tip up.
R音也可以通过翻起舌尖来发出。

123
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,060
The lips flare the same way.
嘴唇以同样的方式张开。

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,460
Some native speakers make the R one way, and some the other.
一些母语者用一种方法发R音，另一些用另一种。

125
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,760
Native speakers get the correct sound no matter the mouth position.
母语者无论口腔位置如何都能发出正确的音。

126
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:20,580
But I've found that non-native speakers often drop the jaw too much in this second method, and it makes the sound hollow.
但我发现非母语者在使用第二种方法时常常下巴掉得太多，使得音听起来空洞。

127
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Rrr.
Rrr。

128
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,160
The jaw doesn't need to drop very much for this sound.
这个音不需要下巴掉得太多。

129
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,020
Rrr.
Rrr。

130
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,060
So keep this in mind as you work on one of these two methods.
所以在练习这两种方法之一时要记住这一点。

131
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,420
Here's the R sound on its own, not part of a word.
这是R音本身，不是单词的一部分。

132
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,640
You can see the lips flare.
你可以看到嘴唇张开。

133
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:47,020
Think of creating little space between the inside of your lips and your teeth.
想象在嘴唇内侧和牙齿之间创造一点空间。

134
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,440
Notice how little jaw drop there is.
注意下巴掉得很少。

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,900
We don't need to drop the jaw to pull the tongue back and up.
我们不需要下巴掉下来就能把舌头向后和向上拉。

136
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,780
The word rest.
单词rest。

137
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,120
When the R is at the beginning of a word, we tend to make the lips a tight circle.
当R音在单词开头时，我们倾向于让嘴唇形成一个紧的圆圈。

138
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,400
Again, little jaw drop as the middle of the tongue lifts to the roof of the mouth.
再次，当舌头的中部抬起到口腔顶部时，下巴掉得很少。

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,180
The word proud.
单词proud。

140
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,180
When R is in a beginning consonant cluster, the lips may not be as tight as in a beginning R.
当R音在开头辅音组合中时，嘴唇可能不像开头R音那样紧。

141
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,360
The word mother.
单词mother。

142
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:36,860
At the end of a syllable, the lip position for the R is definitely more relaxed than a beginning R, but the lips still flare.
在音节末尾，R音的嘴唇位置肯定比开头R音更放松，但嘴唇仍然张开。

143
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:47,280
Here, we compare the lip position of the beginning R in REST, above, to the ending R in MOTHER, below.
在这里，我们比较了上面的开头R音在REST中的嘴唇位置和下面的结尾R音在MOTHER中的嘴唇位置。

144
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,480
The ending R lip position is much more relaxed.
结尾R音的嘴唇位置要放松得多。

And now, back to back, you'll see all the other consonant sounds in American English.
现在，你将看到美式英语中的所有其他辅音音。

182
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:57,180
We're going to start with the pairs, like TH, where there are two sounds together, because one is voiced and the other is unvoiced, but they have the same mouth position.
我们将从成对的音开始，比如TH，其中有两个音在一起，因为一个是有声的，另一个是无声的，但它们有相同的口腔位置。

183
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,300
Then we'll get into single sounds, like R.

184
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,160
The P and B consonants.

00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:09,640

P is unvoiced, p, meaning only air passes through the mouth.
P是无声的，p，意味着只有空气通过口腔。

187
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:24,540
And B is voiced, b, meaning you make a sound with the vocal cords.

The lips stay together while the teeth part a little.
嘴唇保持在一起，而牙齿稍微分开。

190
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,840
The tongue position doesn't matter for these consonants, so the tongue can start to get into position for the next sound.
舌头的位置对这些辅音没有影响，所以舌头可以开始为下一个音做好准备。

191
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:50,800
For example, if the next sound is the R consonant, the tongue can move back and up for the R, while the lips close for the B.
例如，如果下一个音是R辅音，舌头可以为R音向后和向上移动，而嘴唇为B音闭合。

196
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,820
In stop consonants, there are two parts.
在爆破音中，有两个部分。

197
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,180
There's a stop of the air flow, and a release.

198
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,580

有时，母语者在句子结尾或下一个单词以辅音开头时，不会释放爆破音。

205
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,020
For example, the common phrase, what's up?
例如，常见短语“what's up?”

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,520
My lips closed in the P position, but I didn't release the air.

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:54,020
These consonants are complicated because the way Americans pronounce them isn't always what you'll find in a dictionary.
这些辅音很复杂，因为美国人发音的方式并不总是字典中所描述的。

300
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,880
First, let's talk about the true pronunciation.
首先，让我们谈谈真正的发音。

301
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,380
These are stop consonants, which means there are two parts.
这些是爆破音，这意味着有两个部分。

302
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,320
First, a stop in the airflow, and second, a release.
首先是气流的阻止，其次是释放。

303
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:18,000
We stop here by closing the vocal cords, and lift the tongue so the flat, top part is at the roof of the mouth.
我们通过闭合声带来阻止气流，并抬起舌头，使平坦的顶部部分在口腔顶部。

304
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:23,180
It's far forward, almost touching the back of the top front teeth.
它靠前，几乎接触到上前牙的后面。

305
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,280
The teeth come together, and we release all three parts at once.
牙齿合在一起，我们同时释放所有三个部分。

306
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,980
The tongue comes down from the roof of the mouth, the teeth part, and we release the air in the throat.
舌头从口腔顶部下来，牙齿分开，我们在喉咙中释放气流。

307
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,620
Tt.
Tt.

308
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,400
Dd.
Dd.

309
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:46,920
Just like with other stop consonants, we want to release them into the next sound.
就像其他爆破音一样，我们希望将它们释放到下一个声音中。

310
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:53,620
Let's look at the true T and D consonants up close and in slow motion.
让我们近距离慢动作观察真正的T和D辅音。

311
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:55,800

313
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,480
The air stops in the throat.
气流在喉咙中停止。

314
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,420
Then, the teeth part, and the tongue pulls down to release.
然后，牙齿分开，舌头下拉释放。

315
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,440
The word DESK.

316
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,160
The teeth close, and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.
牙齿闭合，舌头在口腔顶部。

317
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,960
Then, everything releases right into the EH as in BED vowel.

Then, the teeth release just a bit.
然后，牙齿稍微释放。

324
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,660
There's no next sound to release into, so the movement is minimal for the release.
没有下一个声音可以释放，所以释放的动作很小。

325
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,560
The tongue releases down.
舌头向下释放。

326
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:58,120

334
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,700

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,264

That was the true T and true D.
那是真正的T和真正的D。

338
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:36,840
If the T or D are at the end of a sentence, or if the next word begins with a consonant, then we make a stop T or stop D.
如果T或D在句子末尾，或者下一个单词以辅音开头，那么我们会发出停顿T或停顿D。

339
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,900
We stop the air, but we don't release it.
我们阻止气流，但不释放。

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,800
You lift your tongue into position, stop the air, and that's it.

341
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,400
For example, the word MAD.
例如，单词“MAD”。

342
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,920

The beginning of the D.
D的开始。

345
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:08,360
With the vocal cords engaged, because it's a voiced consonant.
因为它是有声辅音，所以声带参与。

346
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,020
And that's all.
仅此而已。

347
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,600
I don't release.
我不释放。

348
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,440
A release would sound like this.

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,780
MAD.

350

Now let's look at an example with a T followed by another consonant.

355
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,680
The phrase, not for me.
短语“not for me”。

356
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,000
Here the T is followed by F.
这里T后面是F。

357
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,840
I stop the air.

Not for.

361
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:47,040
Not for me.
Not for me.

362
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,120
With stop consonants, we do stop the air in the throat.
对于爆破音，我们在喉咙中阻止气流。

363
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,040
So I don't have to move my tongue up into position for the T to stop the sound.
所以我不必将舌头抬到T的位置来阻止声音。

364
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:06,180
In this phrase, not for me, I touch the roof of my mouth with a part of the tongue that's further back.
在这个短语“not for me”中，我用舌头更靠后的部分接触口腔顶部。

365
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,540

I'll bring my tongue up for the stop T if the next sound also requires the tongue being at the roof of the mouth.
如果下一个声音也需要舌头在口腔顶部，我会抬起舌头来发出停顿T。

371
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:41,660
When I say, not for me, instead of, not for me, the words are more connected and the sentence is smoother.
当我说“not for me”而不是“not for me”时，单词更连贯，句子更流畅。

372
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,680
That's what we want in American English.
这就是我们在美式英语中想要的。

373
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,300
And that's why we use the stop T instead of the true T in these cases.
这就是为什么在这些情况下我们使用停顿T而不是真正的T。

374
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:52,180

Let's look at a stop, up close and in slow motion.

378
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,360
Here's the word, what.
这是单词“what”。

379
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,320
I don't release the T at the end.

380
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
The tongue goes to the roof of the mouth.

381
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,880

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,220
My teeth aren't together and I don't release.

Here's what it looks like with a true T.
这是带有真正T的样子。

386
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,820
The teeth come together, then a subtle release.
牙齿合在一起，然后微妙地释放。

387
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:30,560
Compare the ending.
比较结尾。

388
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,040
The top is what with a stop T and the bottom is what with a true T.
上面是带有停顿T的“what”，下面是带有真正T的“what”。

389
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,460
For the stop T, the teeth don't come together because they don't need to release.
对于停顿T，牙齿不合在一起，因为它们不需要释放。

390
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,140
The air simply stops with the tongue in position.
气流只是用舌头在位置上停止。

391
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,380
For the true T, we bring the teeth together so the tongue, teeth, and air release.
对于真正的T，我们让牙齿合在一起，以便舌头、牙齿和气流释放。

392
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,700
The stop T and D relate to the true T and D.
停顿T和D与真正的T和D有关。

393
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,140
We simply skip the release.
我们只是跳过释放。

394
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:12,760
But when the T or D come between two vowels or diphthongs, or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong, we make a different sound.
但当T或D位于两个元音或双元音之间，或在R之后和元音或双元音之前时，我们发出不同的声音。

395
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,720
One exception.
一个例外。

396
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,620
If the T or D starts a stressed syllable, then it's a true T or D.
如果T或D开始一个重读音节，那么它是一个真正的T或D。

397
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:34,880
But in other cases, when the T or D consonants come between two vowels or diphthongs, or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong, we make a flap sound.
但在其他情况下，当T或D辅音位于两个元音或双元音之间，或在R之后和元音或双元音之前时，我们发出一个轻拍音。

398
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,720
This is different from the true and stop T and D because we don't stop the sound.
这与真正的和停顿的T和D不同，因为我们不停止声音。

399
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,520
We don't hold anything.
我们不保持任何东西。

400
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:51,480
We simply let the front part of the tongue bounce against the roof of the mouth without stopping the flow of air.
我们只是让舌头的前部在口腔顶部轻轻弹跳，而不停止气流。

401
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,980
The flap T and flap D sound the same.
闪音T和闪音D听起来是一样的。

402
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,100
The T in matter is the same as the D in matter.
在“matter”这个词中，T和D是一样的。

This sounds just like the R in many languages.

406
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,080
But in American English, it's the flap T or flap D.
但在美式英语中，这是闪音T或闪音D。

407
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,560
In my videos, I use the D symbol for this sound.
在我的视频中，我用D符号来表示这个音。

408
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,660
This sound, however, isn't a stop consonant anymore.
然而，这个音不再是一个爆破音。

409
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:29,820
Let's look at some words with a flap up close and in slow motion.
让我们仔细慢动作看看一些带有闪音的单词。

410
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,460
The word city.
单词“city”。

411
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,780
Here, the T comes between two vowel sounds, so it's a flap.
这里，T在两个元音之间，所以是一个闪音。

412
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,360
The tongue is in position for the IH vowel.
舌头处于IH元音的位置。

413
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:43,460
Watch how it flaps the roof of the mouth quickly.

416
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,620

The word party.

Here, the T comes after an R and before a vowel, so it's a flap.
这里，T在R之后和元音之前，所以是一个闪音。

420
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,320
The tongue is back and up for the R.

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,460
And come down from the flap.
然后从闪音中下来。

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,660

再看整个单词一遍。

00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,500
The word tidy.
单词“tidy”。

426
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,100
Here, the D comes after a diphthong and before a vowel, so it's a flap D.
这里，D在双元音之后和元音之前，所以是一个闪音D。

427
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,040
Watch the tongue flap.
看舌头如何拍打。

428
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,180
The whole word one more time.
整个单词再来一遍。

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,060
Then you can really feel the tongue flap, bouncing against the roof of the mouth.
然后你可以真正感觉到舌头拍打，撞击上颚。

432
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,140
Remember, this isn't represented in dictionaries.
记住，这在字典中没有表示。

433
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:04,096
They will show the symbol for the true T, party, even though Americans pronounce it party.
他们会显示真正的T的符号，party，即使美国人发音是party。

434
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:06,860
So remember the rule.
所以记住这个规则。

435
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:21,200

The word, keep.
单词“keep”。

00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:36,380
Because the tongue lifts at the back and does not require much jaw drop, it's hard to see this sound in this word.
因为舌头在后部抬起，不需要太多下巴下垂，所以在这个单词中很难看到这个音。

561
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,200
