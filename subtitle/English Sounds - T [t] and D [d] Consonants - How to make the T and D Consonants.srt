00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,820
In this American English pronunciation video, we're going to study how to make the T and D consonant sounds.
在这段美式英语发音视频中，我们将学习如何发出 T 和 D 辅音音。

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,540
These two sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.
这两个音被放在一起是因为它们的口腔位置相同。

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:32,700
Tt is unvoiced, meaning only air passes through the mouth, and dd is voiced, meaning dd.
T 是无声的，意味着只有空气通过口腔，而 D 是有声的，意味着发出声音。

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,800
You make a sound with the vocal cords.
你用声带发出声音。

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,920
These consonants are complicated because the way Americans pronounce them isn't always what you'll find in a dictionary.
这些辅音很复杂，因为美国人发音的方式并不总是你在字典中找到的那样。

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,800
First, let's talk about the true pronunciation.
首先，让我们谈谈真正的发音。

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,280
These are stop consonants, which means there are two parts.
这些是爆破音，这意味着有两个部分。

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,220
First, a stop in the airflow, and second, a release.
首先是气流的阻断，其次是释放。

9
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:08,920
We stop here by closing the vocal cords, and lift the tongue so the flat, top part is at the roof of the mouth.
我们通过闭合声带来阻断气流，并抬起舌头，使平坦的顶部部分在口腔的顶部。

10
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:14,080
It's far forward, almost touching the back of the top front teeth.
它的位置很靠前，几乎接触到上前牙的后面。

11
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,160
The teeth come together, and we release all three parts at once.
牙齿合拢，我们同时释放所有三个部分。

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,880
The tongue comes down from the roof of the mouth, the teeth part, and we release the air in the throat.
舌头从口腔顶部下来，牙齿分开，我们在喉咙中释放空气。

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,760
Tt, dd.
Tt, dd.

14
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:37,800
Just like with other stop consonants, we want to release them into the next sound.
就像其他爆破音一样，我们希望将它们释放到下一个音中。

15
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:44,520
Let's look at the true T and D consonants up close and in slow motion.
让我们近距离慢动作观察真正的 T 和 D 辅音。

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,320
The air stops in the throat, then the teeth part and the tongue pulls down to release.
空气在喉咙中停止，然后牙齿分开，舌头下拉释放。

17
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,080
The word desk.
单词 desk。

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,080
The teeth close and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.
牙齿合拢，舌头在口腔顶部。

19
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:08,860
Then everything releases right into the EH as in bed vowel.
然后一切释放到 EH 音中，就像 bed 中的元音。

20
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,620
The word stick.
单词 stick。

21
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,480
The teeth close and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.
牙齿合拢，舌头在口腔顶部。

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,800
Then everything releases right into the IH as in sit vowel.
然后一切释放到 IH 音中，就像 sit 中的元音。

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,900
The word expect.

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,220
The teeth nearly close and the tongue is at the roof of the mouth.
牙齿几乎合拢，舌头在口腔顶部。

25
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
Then the teeth release just a bit.
然后牙齿稍微释放。

26
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:40,500
There's no next sound to release into, so the movement is minimal for the release.
没有下一个音可以释放，所以释放的动作很小。

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,460
The tongue releases down.
舌头向下释放。

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,020
It's possible to make the true D without the teeth coming together.
可以在不让牙齿合拢的情况下发出真正的 D 音。

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,560
Said, dd, dd.
Said, dd, dd.

30
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,620
Because of the voice in this sound, we can still release it.
由于这个音是有声的，我们仍然可以释放它。

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
Said, dd.
Said, dd.

32
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:08,180
But to make the true T, the teeth do have to come together or nearly together.
但要发出真正的 T 音，牙齿必须合拢或几乎合拢。

33
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,860
Set, tt, tt.
Set, tt, tt.

34
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,420
That was the true T and true D.
那是真正的 T 和真正的 D。

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:27,740
If the T or D are at the end of a sentence, or if the next word begins with a consonant, then we make a stop T or stop D.
如果 T 或 D 在句子的末尾，或者下一个单词以辅音开头，那么我们发出停顿 T 或停顿 D。

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,780
We stop the air, but we don't release it.
我们阻止空气，但不释放它。

37
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:37,700
You lift your tongue into position, stop the air, and that's it.
你将舌头抬到位，阻止空气，仅此而已。

38
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,080
For example, the word mad.
例如，单词 mad。

39
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,820
Mad.
Mad.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:59,240
Notice the last sound is, dd, dd, the beginning of the D, dd, dd, with the vocal cords engaged because it's a voiced consonant.
注意最后的音是 dd, dd，是 D 的开始，dd, dd，因为它是有声辅音，声带参与。

41
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,920
And that's all.
就是这样。

42
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,500
I don't release.
我不释放。

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,980
A release would sound like this, mad, dd.
释放会听起来像这样，mad, dd。

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,140
But instead, I say mad, dd, leaving my tongue tip up.
但相反，我说 mad, dd，舌尖保持上抬。

45
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:23,580
Now let's look at an example with a T followed by another consonant, the phrase, not for me.
现在让我们看一个 T 后面跟着另一个辅音的例子，短语 not for me。

46
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,900
Here the T is followed by F.
这里 T 后面是 F。

47
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,540
I stop the air, not, and then without releasing, go into the F sound.
我阻止空气，not，然后不释放，进入 F 音。

48
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:36,260
Not for.
Not for.

49
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:37,920
Not for me.
Not for me.

50
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:43,020
With stop consonants, we do stop the air in the throat.
对于停顿辅音，我们确实在喉咙中阻止空气。

51
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,940
So I don't have to move my tongue up into position for the T to stop the sound.
所以我不必将舌头抬到 T 的位置来阻止声音。

52
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:57,060
In this phrase, not for me, I touch the roof of my mouth with a part of the tongue that's further back.
在这个短语中，not for me，我用舌头更靠后的部分接触口腔顶部。

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
Not.
Not.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,420
My tongue tip can stay down.
我的舌尖可以保持下垂。

55
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,220
This helps me make the stop even shorter, so I can quickly go into the next sound.
这帮助我使停顿更短，以便我可以快速进入下一个音。

56
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:11,440
Not for.
Not for.

57
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,040
Not for.
Not for.

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,800
I'll bring my tongue up for the stop T if the next sound also requires the tongue being at the roof of the mouth.
如果下一个音也需要舌头在口腔顶部，我会将舌头抬起以发出停顿 T。

59
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:32,580
When I say, not for me, instead of, not for me, the words are more connected and the sentence is smoother.
当我说 not for me 而不是 not for me 时，单词更连贯，句子更流畅。

60
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:41,180
That's what we want in American English, and that's why we use the stop T instead of the true T in these cases.
这就是我们在美式英语中想要的，这也是为什么在这些情况下我们使用停顿 T 而不是真正的 T。

61
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:43,080
Not for me.
Not for me.

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,940
Not for me.
Not for me.

63
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,080
Not for me.
Not for me.

64
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:52,520
Let's look at a stop up close and in slow motion.
让我们近距离慢动作观察一个停顿。

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,260
Here's the word, what.
这是单词 what。

66
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,220
I don't release the T at the end.
我不释放结尾的 T。

67
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,000
The tongue goes to the roof of the mouth.
舌头到达口腔顶部。

68
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,760
But then I just stop the air.
但然后我只是阻止空气。

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
My teeth aren't together, and I don't release.
我的牙齿没有合拢，我不释放。

70
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,580
The lips simply close.
嘴唇只是闭合。

71
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,060
What.
What.

72
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,940
Here's what it looks like with a true T.
这是带有真正 T 的样子。

73
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,720
The teeth come together, then a subtle release.
牙齿合拢，然后微妙地释放。

74
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:21,460
Compare the ending.
比较结尾。

75
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,920
The top is what with a stop T, and the bottom is what with a true T.
上面是带有停顿 T 的 what，下面是带有真正 T 的 what。

76
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,360
For the stop T, the teeth don't come together because they don't need to release.
对于停顿 T，牙齿不合拢，因为它们不需要释放。

77
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
The air simply stops with the tongue in position.
空气只是随着舌头在位置上停止。

78
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,280
For the true T, we bring the teeth together so the tongue, teeth, and air release.
对于真正的 T，我们将牙齿合拢，以便舌头、牙齿和空气释放。

79
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,600
The stop T and D relate to the true T and D.
停顿 T 和 D 与真正的 T 和 D 相关。

80
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,040
We simply skip the release.
我们只是跳过释放。

81
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:03,640
But when the T or D come between two vowels or diphthongs, or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong, we make a different sound.
但当 T 或 D 位于两个元音或双元音之间，或在 R 之后和元音或双元音之前时，我们发出不同的声音。

82
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,620
One exception.
一个例外。

83
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,520
If the T or D starts a stressed syllable, then it's a true T or D.
如果 T 或 D 开始一个重读音节，那么它是一个真正的 T 或 D。

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:25,780
But in other cases, when the T or D consonants come between two vowels or diphthongs, or after an R and before a vowel or diphthong, we make a flap sound.
但在其他情况下，当 T 或 D 辅音位于两个元音或双元音之间，或在 R 之后和元音或双元音之前时，我们发出一个闪音。

85
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:32,620
This is different from the true and stop T and D because we don't stop the sound.
这与真正的和停顿的 T 和 D 不同，因为我们不停止声音。

86
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,400
We don't hold anything.
我们不保持任何东西。

87
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:42,360
We simply let the front part of the tongue bounce against the roof of the mouth without stopping the flow of air.
我们只是让舌头的前部在口腔顶部轻轻弹跳，而不停止气流。

88
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,880
The flap T and flap D sound the same.
闪音 T 和闪音 D 听起来一样。

89
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:53,240
The T in MATTER is the same as the D in MATTER.
MATTER 中的 T 和 MATTER 中的 D 是一样的。

92
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,160
This sounds just like the R in many languages.
这听起来就像许多语言中的 R。

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,980
But in American English, it's the flap T or flap D.
但在美式英语中，它是闪音 T 或闪音 D。

94
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,460
In my videos, I use the D symbol for this sound.
在我的视频中，我用 D 符号表示这个音。

95
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:14,540
This sound, however, isn't a stop consonant anymore.
然而，这个音不再是爆破音。

96
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:20,720
Let's look at some words with a flap up close and in slow motion.

99
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,260
The tongue is in position for the IH vowel.

117
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,740
They will show the symbol for the true T, PARTY, even though Americans pronounce it PARTY.
它们会显示真正的 T 符号，PARTY，即使美国人发音为 PARTY。

118
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,760
So remember the rule.
所以记住这个规则。

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:12,100
When a T or D comes between vowels and diphthongs, or after an R, before a vowel or diphthong, like PARTY, unless it starts a stressed syllable, flap the tongue.
当 T 或 D 位于元音和双元音之间，或在 R 之后，元音或双元音之前时，比如 PARTY，除非它开始一个重读音节，否则舌头弹跳。

120
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:17,200
Sometimes we drop the T or D completely.
有时我们完全省略 T 或 D。

121
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,180
We leave the sounds out.
我们省略这些音。

122
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,360
This is an American habit.
这是美国人的习惯。

123
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,700
If you look up the words in the dictionary, the sounds are there.
如果你在字典中查找这些单词，音是存在的。

124
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:31,400
There are two cases when you might hear an American word, drop a T or D.
有两种情况你可能会听到一个美国单词省略 T 或 D。

125
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,360
First, when the T or D comes between two consonant sounds.
首先，当 T 或 D 位于两个辅音音之间时。

126
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,900
For example, exactly.
例如，exactly。

127
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:45,820
This word has the K, T, L consonants together.
这个单词有 K, T, L 辅音在一起。

128
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,220
But most people pronounce it without the T.
但大多数人发音时省略 T。

129
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,620
Exactly.
Exactly.

130
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,160

132
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:04,220
