In this American English pronunciation video, we're going to learn how to pronounce the P and B consonants.
在这段美式英语发音视频中，我们将学习如何发音P和B辅音。

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,940
These two sounds are paired together because they take the same mouth position.
这两个音被放在一起是因为它们的口型相同。

3
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:37,060
P is unvoiced, P, meaning only air passes through the mouth, and B is voiced, b, meaning you make a sound with the vocal cords, b.
P是不发声的，P，意味着只有空气通过口腔，而B是发声的，b，意味着你用声带发出声音，b。

4
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,340
The lips stay together while the teeth part a little.
嘴唇保持闭合，而牙齿稍微分开。

5
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:50,140
The tongue position doesn't matter for these consonants, so the tongue can start to get into position for the next sound.
对于这些辅音，舌头的位置并不重要，因此舌头可以开始为下一个音做准备。

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:02,100
For example, if the next sound is the R consonant, the tongue can move back and up for the R, while the lips close for the B.
例如，如果下一个音是R辅音，舌头可以向后和向上移动为R做准备，而嘴唇为B闭合。
